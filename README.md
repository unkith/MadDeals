# MadDeals_2.0_REACT
# New Repo for MadDeals

#1. In order to use, just run 'npm start' in the terminal while in the project directory, and install Expo on your phone, then scan the QR code given by the terminal and you should see how the app looks!

#2. Dashboard.js has been created for the homepage, there you guys can coordinate and add the Home Page details etc.

#3. I have invited you guys onto the Firebase project so any changes can be seen in the FireStore db

#4. I guess we can push to our own branches and then merge with main?
